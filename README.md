HelloðŸ‘‹, my name is Mark and I'm a Bioinformatics and Computational Genomics graduate from Queen's University Belfast, and I currently work as a data analyst coach and instructor for a data apprenticeship provider.

Here I showcase some projects I'm using to improve my data analytics, data science and machine learning skills, specifically for the Bioinformatics field, along with legacy projects including my Master's research investigating genetic changes in brain cancer cell linesðŸ§¬
